# agoric-3-proposals

Proposals run or planned for Mainnet (agoric-3)

This repo serves several functions:

- verify building an image with in which known proposals have executed
- publishing a multiplatform image with all passed proposals
- verify that certain tests pass after each proposal

# Design

## Stages

The build is [multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) with several kinds of stages:

- `START` The very first stage, which run `ag0` instead of `agd` as the other layers do. (This was the version of `agd` before JS VM.)
- `PREPARE` For upgrade proposals: submits the proposal, votes on it, runs to halt for the next stage
- `EXECUTE` For ugprade proposals: starts `agd` with the new SDK, letting its upgrade handler upgrade the chain
- `EVAL` For core-eval proposals: submits the proposal, votes on it, and begin executing. Does not guarantee the eval will finish but does wait several blocks to give it a chance.

All proposals then have two additional stages:

- `USE` Perform actions to update the chain state, to persist through the chain history. E.g. adding a vault that will be tested again in the future.
- `TEST` Test the chain state and perform new actions that should not be part of history. E.g. adding a contract that never was on Mainnet.

The `TEST` stage does not RUN as part of the build. It only deifnes the ENTRYPOINT and CI runs them all.

## Proposals

### Types

- Software Upgrade Ã  la https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/live-upgrade-tutorial.html
- Core Eval
- Not yet supported: combo Upgrade/Eval

### Naming

Each proposal is defined as a subdirectory of `propoals`. E.g. `16:upgrade-8`.

The leading number is its number as submitted to the agoric-3 chain. These are viewable at https://bigdipper.live/agoric/proposals

The string after `:` is the local label for the proposal. It should be distinct, concise, and lowercase. (The string is used in the Dockerfile in a token that must be lowercase.)

If the proposal is _pending_ and does not yet have a number, use a letter. The proposals are run in lexical order so all letters execute after all the numbers are done.

### Files

- `config.json` specifies what kind of proposal it is. If it's a "Software Upgrade Proposal" it also includes additional parameters.
- `use.sh` is the script that will be run in the USE stage of the build
- `test.sh` is the script that will be _included_ in the TEST stage of the build, and run in CI

# Usage

## Development

To build the test images,

```
./buildTestImages.ts
```

To build the test images for particular proposals,

```
# build just upgrades
./buildTestImages.ts --match upgrade
```

To run the tests for particular proposals,

```
# build just upgrades
./runTestImages.ts --match upgrade
```

## Contributing

To add a proposal, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Images

This repo publishes an image of the synthetic agoric-3 chain with all proposals that have "passed" (defined in this repo as having a proposal number).

The CI builds multiplatform images on every push to the trunk branch, (`main`), and for speed, only default worker platform images for PR branches. You can view all versions at https://github.com/agoric/agoric-3-proposals/pkgs/container/agoric-3-proposals/versions

The multiplatform versions built from the main branch are at: `ghcr.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:main`. For each PR, default worker platform images are at a URL like `ghcr.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:pr-11`.

If you RUN this image, you'll get a working chain running `agd` until you terminate,

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:main
```

Or locally,

```
docker build -t ghrc.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:dev .
docker run  ghrc.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:dev
```

## Future work

- [ ] include a way to test soft patches that weren't proposals (e.g. PismoB)
- [ ] documentation and tooling for debugging
- [ ] separate console output for agd and the scripts (had been with tmux before but trouble, try Docker compose https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/8480#discussioncomment-7438329)
- [ ] way to query capdata in one shot (not resorting to follow jsonlines hackery)
- [ ] within each proposal, separate dirs for supporting files so images don't invalidate
