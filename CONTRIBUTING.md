# Adding a proposal

Each proposal to Mainnet (agoric-3) should be contributed to this repo before being proposed to the chain.

1. Prepare the proposal and verify it by creating a proposal in
   agoric-sdk/a3p-integration. See the
   [README](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/a3p-integration/README.md) for more details.

2. Submit a PR to this repo in which the proposal has a _pending_ name (e.g. `a:my-contract`).

3. Get review and merge to main.

4. When the proposal has been further qualified with higher fidelity to Mainnet, submit to Mainnet.

5. When the proposal passes, submit a PR here converting the pending proposal to a passed one (by
   changing the letter to the submission number).

6. Clean up [agoric-sdk a3p-integration](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/a3p-integration).
   1. Move generally useful tools to the [`@agoric/synthetic-chain` package](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-3-proposals/tree/main/packages/synthetic-chain).
   2. Move tests that should continue to pass afterwards into [proposals/z:acceptance](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/a3p-integration/proposals/z%3Aacceptance).
   3. Remove the passed proposal.
