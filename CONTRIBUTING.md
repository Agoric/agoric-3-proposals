# Adding a proposal

Each proposal to Mainnet (agoric-3) should be contributed to this repo before being proposed to the chain.

1. Prepare the proposal and verify it running locally
2. Submit a PR to this repo in which the proposal has a _pending_ name (e.g. `a:my-contract`)
3. Get review and merge to main
4. When the proposal has been further qualified with higher fidelity to Mainnet, submit to Mainnet
5. When the proposal passes, submit a PR here converting the pending proposal to a passed one (by changing the letter to the submission number)
