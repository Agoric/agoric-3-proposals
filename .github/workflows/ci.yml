name: Proposal tests

# NB: This job works differently for PRs and non-PRs. If you make significant changes,
# be sure to manually trigger the non-PR workflow before merging.

# In PRS,
# - build and run 'test' images
# - no pushing of images
#
# In `main` pushes and manual triggers,
# - build and run 'test' images
# - build 'use' images for *all passed proposals* AND push to registry (e.g. use-upgrade-10)

# In both cases it uses a remote builder with depot.dev (see depot.json) to get a persistent
# build cache and automatic multiplatform builds and image management.

# If `main` fails, you'll make a PR to fix it but its CI will only run the PR flow above.
# To test the non-PR way, you need to manually trigger this workflow by going to,
# https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-3-proposals/actions/workflows/ci.yml
# and clicking "Run workflow", specifying this branch.
