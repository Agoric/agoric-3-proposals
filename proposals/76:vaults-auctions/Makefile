# This Makefile is here to help you find out what went on the
# chain for a CoreEval proposal such as #76 for vaults / auctions.

##
# Find the proposal transaction

# To find the transaction, let's start with: Who proposed 76?
proposer.json:

# Get proposer's transaction history.

	jq '.txs | .[] | select(.tx.body.messages[0].content["@type"] == "/agoric.swingset.CoreEvalProposal")' \

# A CoreEval proposal has a sequence of json_permits,js_code pairs.
# We happen to know there were 2 in this case, and we have
# been using certain filenames for them.
