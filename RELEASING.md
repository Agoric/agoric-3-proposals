# Publishing to NPM

So far there is little process to publish a new version of `@agoric/synthetic-chain` to NPM. (https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-3-proposals/issues/60 is to develop automation.)

1. Bump the version number in `synthetic-chain/package.json`.
2. PR to get it approved.
3. When approved, run `npm publish` in the branch and merge.

You may need credentials to publish. Contact IT.
